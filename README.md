- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Bobby! Thanks for checking out my GitHub!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning more about development. I work in recruitment and find the best way talk to developers is to get stuck in.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the webstack, so HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS for now.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me - you can contact me at bobby@tttechrec.com, or /in/bobbykamal/ on LinkedIn!
